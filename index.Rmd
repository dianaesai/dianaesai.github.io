### Welcome! 
My name is Diana Sanchez and I am a second year Master of Public Health student at Columbia University. I am currently taking Data Science, a class where I have been learning to code in R. This website serves as a great example of my expertise. Please feel free to look around to get to know me better, and shoot me an email if you have any questions!
